# cesium-angular-example

A simple web application that demonstrates integration of [Cesium](https://cesiumjs.org/) with [Angular](https://angular.io/).

## Setup

Run `npm install -g @angular/cli` to install **Angular CLI**.

Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
